## Conclusions

1. **HDI Successfully Processes Diverse Properties**: The system handled Houston inner-loop, Oak Forest premium, and Katy suburban properties equally well.

2. **Perplexity AI is Highly Effective**: It found accurate, current market data including recent sales, rental estimates, and neighborhood trends for all properties.

3. **Investment Intelligence Works**: HDI correctly identified:
   - High-yield opportunity (Ella Blvd)
   - Premium neighborhood play (Lamonte Lane)
   - Suburban value proposition (Spotted Owl)

4. **Data Fusion Needs Completion**: With HCAD and permits data, confidence scores would jump from 40% to 80-100%.
