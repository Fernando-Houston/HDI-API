### ðŸ”§ Voice AI Implementation Code

```javascript
class HoustonVoiceAI {
  constructor() {
    this.apiBase = 'https://hdi-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1';
    this.context = {};
  }

  async processVoiceCommand(spokenText) {
    // 1. Try voice search first
    const searchResult = await this.voiceSearch(spokenText);
    
    if (searchResult.count > 0) {
      // Found properties
      return this.formatPropertyResponse(searchResult.properties[0]);
    }
    
    // 2. Fall back to AI chat for complex questions
    const aiResponse = await this.askAI(spokenText);
    return aiResponse.answer;
  }

  async voiceSearch(spokenText) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.apiBase}/properties/voice-search`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ spoken_text: spokenText })
    });
    return response.json();
  }

  async askAI(question) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.apiBase}/properties/ask`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ 
        question, 
        context: this.context,
        search_web: true 
      })
    });
    return response.json();
  }

  formatPropertyResponse(property) {
    return `I found a property at ${property.address}. 
            It's valued at $${property.marketValue.toLocaleString()} 
            with ${property.squareFeet} square feet. 
            Would you like more details?`;
  }
}
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Voice Response Best Practices

1. **Number Formatting**
   - $450,000 â†’ "four hundred fifty thousand dollars"
   - 2,500 sq ft â†’ "twenty five hundred square feet"

2. **Address Speaking**
   - "924 ZOE ST" â†’ "nine twenty four Zoe Street"
   - Spell out abbreviations: "ST" â†’ "Street", "AVE" â†’ "Avenue"

3. **Error Responses**
   ```javascript
   const voiceErrors = {
     no_results: "I couldn't find any properties matching that description. Could you be more specific?",
     api_error: "I'm having trouble accessing property data right now. Please try again.",
     unclear: "I didn't quite catch that. Could you repeat the address?"
   };
   ```

### ðŸ“Š Conversation Context Management

```javascript
// Maintain context across questions
let conversation = {
  currentProperty: null,
  searchHistory: [],
  lastQuestion: null
};

// Example conversation flow:
// User: "Find 924 Zoe Street"
conversation.currentProperty = searchResult.properties[0];

// User: "What about the taxes?" (context-aware follow-up)
const followUp = await askAI("What about the property taxes?", {
  property_data: conversation.currentProperty
});
```

### ðŸš€ Performance Tips

1. **Cache Common Searches**
   - Popular neighborhoods
   - Frequently asked properties
   - Market trend data (update daily)

2. **Preload Voice Responses**
   - Generate voice-friendly summaries in advance
   - Store formatted number pronunciations

3. **Batch Requests**
   - If showing multiple properties, use `/batch/analyze`
   - Prefetch nearby properties for "show me more" commands
